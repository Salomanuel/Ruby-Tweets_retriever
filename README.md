## TWITTER MEGA NINJA TWEETS

### the task:

Write a Ruby command line application that asks for a Twitter user name and shows the latest tweets mentioning that user.

# notes
Twitter's Search API returns only tweets from the past 7 days. So if you want to retrieve ALL tweets mentioning an arbitrary user, you can't (so far as I know).
